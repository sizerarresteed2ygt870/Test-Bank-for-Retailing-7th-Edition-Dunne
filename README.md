  * The new, Seventh Edition of RETAILING, like much of retailing itself, has undergone significant changes. In fact, given the influence of the Internet, the continuing growth of the service industry, and ongoing changes in the global economy, there has never been a more exciting time to study retailing. As a result, every chapter of this edition includes up-to-date information on the latest trends and practices in this dynamic, fast-paced industry. Even so, the Seventh Edition maintains the text's signature in-depth coverage of fundamental retailing principles, enlivened by the authors' conversational writing style, abundant real-world examples, behind-the-scenes insights, and a vibrant, full-color format.
